# Adaptive Learning Prompting for News Intention Classification

In todayâ€™s interconnected global landscape, political news wields significant influence in shaping voter perceptions. Political news stands as a primary source of information for citizens in democratic societies. Understanding the intentions underlying news articles is indispensable for ensuring transparency in political discourse. It empowers the public to make informed decisions and to hold media platforms accountable for the information they disseminate, whether directly or indirectly.

Accurate identification of news intentions assumes a central role in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for effective information analysis and categorization. This research project delves into the innovative concept of "Adaptive Learning Prompting". It harnesses the formidable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for efficient news intention classification through prompt engineering, with a specific emphasis on resource-constrained scenarios.

Employing a dynamic evaluation methodology conducted in iterative batches, this project meticulously tracks model performance. Through trend analysis, the evolution of the proposed model architecture emerges as statistically significant, effectively proving the adaptability inherent in this proposed approach.

## Introduction

Welcome to the Adaptive Learning Prompting for News Intention Classification project! In today's interconnected global landscape, political news plays a crucial role in shaping voter perceptions and influencing democratic processes. This project focuses on utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to accurately identify news intentions. The core concept is "Adaptive Learning Prompting," which enables efficient news intention classification, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios.

## Features

- Feature 1: Adaptive Learning Prompting
- Feature 2: News Intention Classification
- Feature 3: Resource-Constrained Scenarios

These are the key features of our project.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these installation instructions:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/adaptive-learning-prompting.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd adaptive-learning-prompting

# Install the required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage

To use this project, you can import it in your Python code and utilize its features. Here's an example:

```python

# Import the AdaptiveLearningPrompting class
from adaptive_learning_prompting import AdaptiveLearningPrompting

# Create an instance
alp = AdaptiveLearningPrompting()

# Classify news intentions
intentions = alp.classify_news("Your news text goes here.")
```

All the code is available in the LLM_Dev.ipynb.

## Results

Our project has achieved promising results in accurately classifying news intentions, especially in resource-constrained scenarios. Detailed results and findings are available in our [project report](/results/TFM_CaballeroHinojosaAlberto.pdf) as part of a Master's Thesis and a summary [presentation](/results/PresentationTFM-CaballeroHinojosa.ppt)
